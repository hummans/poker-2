INSTALLATION
============

Open qrcode picture from github page and scan the qr-code with an Android phone. You must have set the option "Unknown sources" under Application Settings. 

HOW TO PLAY
============

The upper cards show the Dealer cards. The lower cards show your cards. Pot amount and winner info is printed to the middle. Chipcounts are printed on the right side of the screen above/below cards. To choose bet amount, press the leftmost button with bet value on it. This will change the bet value. Press bet to bet, check to check. Dealer never folds at the moment. Also, names are hard-coded so Dealer = Peedu and Player = Juhan.
